Agentic ML Recommender System — an autonomous, multi-agent machine learning system that trains, evaluates, critiques, and governs recommendation models using LangGraph and production-grade ML workflows.

An end-to-end **agent-driven machine learning system** that autonomously trains, evaluates, governs, and explains a recommendation model using a structured multi-agent workflow.

The system demonstrates how **agentic decision-making** can be applied to real-world ML pipelines — including hyperparameter exploration, performance critique, governance control, model registration, and explainability.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- Build a **self-governing ML pipeline**
- Replace hardcoded training flows with **agent-based decisions**
- Track experiments and models using **MLflow**
- Ensure explainability and transparency at every stage

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-ml-decision-system.git
cd autonomous-ml-decision-system 
```

2. Create and activate a Python environment:
```bash
conda create -n agentic python=3.10 -y
conda activate agentic
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
4. Run the agentic pipeline:
```bash
python -m experiments/run_agentic_graph.py
```

Output will display hyperparameter exploration, training progress, evaluation metrics, and explanations.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

MLflow (experiment tracking & model registry)

Implicit ALS recommender

FAISS (fast nearest-neighbor retrieval)

LangGraph (agentic workflow orchestration)

NumPy, SciPy, Pandas

⚙️ Notes

The system currently works on COO-format sparse matrices.

Ensure OpenBLAS threads are limited to avoid performance issues:
``` bash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
```
All agents are modular and can be extended with new logic.

📈 Metrics

Precision@10

Recall@10

Model promotion is decided automatically by RegistryAgent.

Explanations are generated by ExplanationAgent for transparency.

📦 Next Steps

Dockerize the pipeline for containerized deployment.

Add more sophisticated recommender models (e.g., LightGCN, Neural Collaborative Filtering).

Integrate with real datasets and live data streams.
